# CFD---Canonical-Examples

This repository contains a series of canonical CFD examples I came across during my Aerospace Engineering degree, here compiled for ease of access.

I've tried to include my own implementations such as the Vorticity Based 2D NS solver over a backward facing step but also some of the material I used to learn while implementing it, all credit goes to the respectives authors.
