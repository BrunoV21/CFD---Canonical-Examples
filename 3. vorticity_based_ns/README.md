## Vorticity Based Navier Stokes

Based on Joe Molvar's work and A. Salih notes, I implemented  a simple vorticity based NS solver. The advantage of the vorticity stream function formulation is that we do not need to solve for pressure so we can geet the 2D flow field by just solving two equations.

You can refer to the pdfs available in the resources dir and try to implement it by yourself.
