## Minimum Length Nozzle

2D steady Potential Flow (inviscid + irrotational) for the design of a minimum length nozzle using the Method of Characteristics.

Tthe throat half height is assumed to be 1.0 𝑚 and 𝛾 = 1.4. The stagnation temperature and stagnation
pressure are 𝑇0 = 400 𝐾 and 𝑃0 = 500 𝑘𝑃𝑎, respectively. The exit Mach number and the number of
characteristic lines are inputs to the application.
